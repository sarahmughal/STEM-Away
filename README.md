# Construction and Analysis of a ceRNA Network Reveals Potential Prognostic Markers in Colorectal Cancer

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide and is derived from an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes. This project explores potential prognostic markers in CRC via the construction and in-depth analysis of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network which was generated through a three-step process in R. 

Identifying new prognostic biomarkers is essential for CRC, as this contributes to exploring the mechanisms of metastasis as well as surveying candidate gene targets for therapy.
